# 2021 gallery
<div class="note">
    <strong>note:</strong> i didn't actually post any art to toni.zone in 2021. if you're looking for art <strong>from</strong> 2021, i released the tiny bit of it that i wanted to as part of the launch content, all of which was uploaded to the <a href="/art/2024">2024 gallery.</a> perhaps i'll date as much as i can properly later on? my priority is simply releasing the website right now.
