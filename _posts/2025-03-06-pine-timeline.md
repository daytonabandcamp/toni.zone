description: "the seventh studio EP by daytona, including two they might be giants covers and three relaxed instrumentals from 2024! mixed and mastered by me today in anticipation for future releases."

it's finally time for *pine timeline,* the seventh studio ep by daytona! a collection of the first faithful covers i've released in a while--composition and lyrics courtesy of the lovely johns of they might be giants fame--as well as a few relatively relaxed instrumentals i was originally gonna flesh out more and publish under a different alias!

as i've been getting back into music, i thought i'd ramp up publication of some buried-until-now tunes from 2024 in anticipation for my next large-scale release (which, for the first time in a few years, will be an *album* and not an ep!) so click [here](https://daytona.bandcamp.com/album/pine-timeline) for 11 minutes of synthy chillout songs set to album art that i threw together in *early* 2021 and dug out of the dirt after four years! i'm just too happy with that cover for it to go unpublished forever, after all!
