description: "of all things, a mario paint drawing i made to see if it was really all it was cracked up to be. i thought it'd be silly, but to my surprise, it was a very pleasant and meditative time! go mario paint!"

just because i thought it'd be funny, i decided to get my hands on mario paint at one point and see what i could do with it. i was expecting to just make a bunch of silly garbage, but i ended up finding mario paint to be a perfectly serviceable experience that was really quite fun! i want to make more things with it someday! (really though, what other kind of opinion would you expect from someone who routinely draws things in ms paint?)
