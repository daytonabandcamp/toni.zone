one poor day in the raucous decade of the 2020s, i was desperate to create a new character. to soothe my restless imagination, i thought of a random species of animal, opened up ms paint, and drew what would become **see ya later gavial.** get it? 'cuz it's like that thing 60-year-old mormon women say except it's a synonym so it's funnier?

usually, the characters i draw don't even have necks, let alone adams apples! he sorta reminds me of croc on the ps1 if he had those famous toni ms paint noodle limbs! maybe i should make something of him one day...
