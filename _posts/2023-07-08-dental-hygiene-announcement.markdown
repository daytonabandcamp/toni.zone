With the deployment of the new website basically underway, I suppose it's time for me to finally make a post to the **music** category. I realize I haven't been putting out much public music at all in the last **eight months** or so, but rest assured, I'm not just a dirty slacker. If you're really close to me, you'll know that I've been working on a lot of new music in private recently, but I think it's finally time for me to come out of the woodwork and announce some **new Daytona content** coming soon to a [Bandcamp](https://daytona.bandcamp.com) near you!

I am actually working on **two EPs** at once right now! One of them is bigger and more important, and I will be officially announcing it a bit later on, but the other is called (if you haven't guessed yet) **Dental Hygiene!** Dental Hygiene is a collection of **five** one-minute songs of varying silliness which, believe it or not, have **absolutely nothing** to do with dental hygiene proper! <span style="color: dimgray"><small>(The reason it's called that is because I was originally making these songs for a 5-minute-long set for a urlfest whose proceeds were going to a friend's tooth surgery, but my perfectionism got in the way of me being fast enough to make the cut. Now I'm just doing it for fun! Don't worry, she is fine.)</small></span>

If you're worried about my progress, I have one song complete for the big secret EP, and one song **complete** and another **in progress** for the Dental Hygiene EP. I'm chipping away at it! Dental Hygiene will hopefully be coming **this August!** Though, if you've been paying attention to the development of this website, you know I'm a bit more optimistic than I should be about the spontaneous bursts of focused energy that fuel my executive function... so don't quote me on that. As for the other EP, I guess I should **announce** it after this one releases, but I can't tell you a proper release date. Let's hope it comes out sometime this year! That's all I'll say.

For now, check out the stuff I've recently released on by Bandcamp, like [this wicked cover](https://daytona.bandcamp.com/track/whopper) of the Burger King song, [THIS wicked cover](https://daytona.bandcamp.com/track/the-middle-jimmy-eat-world-cover) of one of my favorite comfort songs of all time, or [this weirdly-produced album](https://daytona.bandcamp.com/album/planets-and-donuts) that I've grown to become more and more personally polarized with over time. Who knows? Maybe you'll find enjoyment where I found self-doubt! That's what music's all about. See you on the Bandcamp side! â™¥
