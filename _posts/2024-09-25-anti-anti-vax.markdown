anti-vaxxers suck. have you ever wanted to tell an anti-vax parent how much they suck? because you should. and if i may suggest an image for you to use, here's one that i drew in... *probably* 2023? i could be very wrong. it might've been earlier, just because my sona's hairstyle changed massively throughout the course of 2023 and '24. i should draw something showcasing the evolution soon to upload here! i'm getting off track. fuck anti-vax parents.
