i think the title is pretty self explanatory here. i've been so exposed to overused, oversanitized stock cartoon art over the years that images like the one of spongebob clasping his hands together and blushing or the one of homer simpson crossing his arms and doing the weird thousand-yard stare have become... entertainingly intimidating in their pervasiveness. this art capitalizes on that!

(made as a silly little test for my drawing-from-reference skills. gotta keep that spongebob on-model!)
