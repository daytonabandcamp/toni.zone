![the creaking](/img/art/creaking.gif)

usually i don't draw scenery to go with my art--or animate it, for that matter--but i recently got my little transgender hands on the latest minecraft snapshot featuring the pale garden and the creaking, and i gotta say, as rare as the biome is, i like it! i love the new wood type and i think the "creaking heart" idea is really fun and unique! if you've been following along with my status.cafe updates at all, you'd know i had some trouble finding it.

the creaking is just *so* elusive, though, that i had to take a stab at drawing him myself! or, i guess... my take on how i would've designed him. i just don't quite think they went far enough with the whole "asymmetry" thing, so i decided to put his arm in a different place! i hope you don't mind. if you do mind, just focus on how nice those wood textures came out. i sure am proud of how i drew them!

side note: do you like custom aseprite brushes? because i just started using them and i love them. expect many more in the future!
