i actually finished jelly belly nebula a few months ago--even if it doesn't feel like it--but i noticed the music section of the site was looking rather barren of any of my actual music. it'd be kind of silly of me to *retroactively* make a post for all of my different musical endeavors and *describe them within their respective posts accordingly.* this one is different, though! i spent a very, very long time on this and i think it deserves to be bumped. if you like electronica and synth-y space music, sit down and listen! <a href="https://daytona.bandcamp.com/album/jelly-belly-nebula">it's only twenty minutes!</a>
