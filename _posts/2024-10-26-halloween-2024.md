the witching hour is upon us! and as such, the halloween toni.zone theme has arrived! i've been preparing for this since i dropped the site, and now the time is finally here! halloween really sneaks up on you, doesn't it? among all the horrible bones and spooky shrieks, i've realized the importance of making your code customizable, readable and adaptable!

the scariest part of halloween is how close it can get before your brain is startled into halloween-mode, and if it hadn't happened sooner, the halloween theme might never have existed. if i *were to have had* to push it until the day of, though, i would've had to add all of the theme functionality to the site (so i don't necessarily have to update everything before and after *every* halloween) extremely quickly!

for a while, it was a bit difficult for me to see the practical value of using things like css variables in a solo project where i don't have to worry about everyone else's death leers. now i realize they are the best thing ever! the floodgates have now opened up to the idea of adding *even more* themes to the site, and maybe even a *theme selector?* how does everyone feel about that? :D

i'm sorry if i'm rambling a little bit right now. to be entirely honest, my brain is only half-focused on writing this post. i'm in a really raucous group voice chat with about 4 other people. as for my plans for halloween, i don't usually have any! in retrospect, it may have been totally fine for me to spend a bit more time on this theme or to, well, wait to add the theme functionality until the day of.

i wanted to make a new browser game for this halloween--in fact, i wanted to start planning it about five months ago--but i've been procrastinating. now that i know how much intense playtesting something as simple as *[lootcreate](/gamez/2024/lootcreate)* requires before being even remotely playable, though, i'm thinking i'm gonna have to push it to next halloween. i mean... given that i came up with the *concept* of the game three halloweens ago already, what's one more year-long delay gonna hurt?

the new *halloween splashes* (the text in the speech bubble next to my silly pumpkin face) are very much reference-based this year. i dare you to find all the different crazy song lyric and cartoon references and whatnot! â™¥
