description: "the small update i made about the status of the website's completion when i was 21. if you can't tell, a lot of the posts that have a 'retroactive description' such as this were copypasted from the original toni.zone."

Well, I guess I'm basically **done!** I know I said that before, but that was back when my web design knowledge was really in its infancy, and I didn't know all that I would actually have to tend to in pursuit of a website built from scratch without a tool like Neocities that **I myself** am paying to host. Privacy policies are so annoying. I wish I could've given y'all more launch content, but I'd rather not wait another billion years before I finally send this thing online.

See, **a website is like your baby child.** You can either shelter it for years and cause it to be awkward, scared and confused when it finally sails out into the real world, or do your best raising it for a reasonable period of time and then see what happens when you let it be free. Finding Nemo was such a good movie. Anyway, I've been doing the former for quite a long time, and I think it's finally starting to become unhealthy! Let's do a little bit of the latter. More content coming soon! â™¥
