a legally distinct sprinkled donut with pink icing that has nothing to do with network television, completely removed from any balding yellow cartoon men or nuclear power plants. i wanted to make a blender donut because i felt left out, but everyone else was making them using a tutorial and i thought that was boring. and yes, maybe mine would look much more realistic if i'd spent more time on it and put more thought into it, but really... do you want it to look realistic or do you want it to look delicious and appealing?
