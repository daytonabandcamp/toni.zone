i've always loved playing american truck simulator. as a denizen of the southwest united states myself, reveling in my own culture and constantly breaking traffic laws admittedly bring me a lot of joy! even more than playing truck simulator, though, i love drawing graphics for my truck. i've drawn up more truck-sides than just these two, but these are definitely my favorites! the first one is from 2022, the second is from 2023. if you can't tell, my sona's hairstyle has changed just a bit! i'm honestly really happy with the decision to make that second one look like corrugated steel.
