![busted!](/img/art/candace.png)

in the middle of 2023, i rewatched the first 3 seasons of phineas and ferb and watched the 4th for the first time! after finishing each season, i wanted to do a little drawing of a specific character and a 6-letter word that i think suits them the best. after season 1, i chose candace and drew this as a reference to **"busted,"** her amazing and iconic duet with vanessa from the doofania episode.

i was wanting to draw doofenshmirtz saying "inator" after season 2, and i did, but i drew it on a whiteboard because i was lazy and... also in the mood to draw something on a whiteboard. i'm gonna have to make it pretty at some point and post it! i... never did anything for seasons 3 or 4. i wonder what i'll end up doing for season 5!

ps: you may notice some shaky and inconsistent linework in this art! that's because i did it with a small challenge in mind: draw the entire thing in ms paint and do not switch to any other software for any reason. i made the background in paint, i made all the drop shadows in paint, and i colored it all in paint! are you proud of me? i bet you are.

pps: please don't get mad at me over the inconsistency in where i put art vs. where i put descriptions. i play it by ear as to whether i should put the art on top and the description on the bottom or vice versa. this one is extra long!
