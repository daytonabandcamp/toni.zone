I'm so small, so alone in cyberspace

It takes so much werewithal

To get away from it all

The busy yet distant

Chipper yet sorrowful

To become

Alone yet content

Bleak yet happy

<br>

I'm so small, so alone in cyberspace

Rejecting their wealth

Remembering self

In isolated contact

Unrelenting relief

Finding myself

Delusional and nostalgic

But perhaps I'm neither

<br>

I'm so small, so alone in cyberspace

Yet how alone am I really
