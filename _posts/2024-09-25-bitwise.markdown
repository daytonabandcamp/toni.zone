description: "a delightful (but quite possibly dubious) and oddly golang-centric tutorial about bitwise operators i made when i was 20! being entirely honest, i have not had to use them since. i still think the art is cute, though!"

i made this (and corrected it as best i could) a *while* ago, so... please don't use this as an educational resource. regardless, see how much you can learn about bitwise operators from this weirdly formatted, silly-looking aseprite drawing from the sproutless days of yore!
