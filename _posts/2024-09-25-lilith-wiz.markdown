a silly wizard girl i drew in november 2023. i posted it to my friend's discord server and after a small discussion about what to name her, we decided to call her lilith wiz! also, how weird is it seeing five-fingered hands on one of my drawings? that's something i almost never do! also no, she isn't a witch. witches and warlocks draw their power from the occult, forming infernal pacts with demons and whatnot. she's not like that. wizards learn magic through careful study and books, and they--of course--can be of any gender! ...ignore that i named the image "witch.png."

**side note:** this might be the only ms paint drawing i've ever made that actually uses the spraypaint tool! see if you can spot it!
