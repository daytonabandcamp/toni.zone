description: "the first true toni.zone post ever! written all the way back when i was 19 on good ol' daytona.neocities.org, this ancient relic of a ranked list pits smash characters in a battle to be the most silly! it's... not great."
---
<small>[**preamble:** i was a little bit less bright when i was 19. looking back, i realized i forgot to add in a few characters! (or update the list to reflect the complete roster after they stopped doing the DLC.) instead of adding to the list and ruining a historic artifact of this website, let's go over them first!</small>

<small>to be honest, i'd put **rosalina and luma** very, very far towards the serious side. her backstory is so fucking heartbreaking that she'd probably go *under* snake and above sephiroth. the mishmash of retcon fuckshit that is baby rosalina may exist, but definitely not in this game. sakurai's too good for that.</small>

<small>jeez, of all the characters i could've forgotten, it had to be **ike.** believe it or not, i don't have much of an opinion about him because i haven't played fire emblem ever, nor have i ever had an interest in it! i ranked all the fire emblem characters between #66 and #62, so that's where he'd go. as for specifics, hm... his sword is more intimidating than chrom's. i think that might make him the most serious one! also, it says he's the leader of some group? i'll take that into consideration too. let's put him *above* sheik and *under* cloud.</small>

<small>and finally, the one i *knew* i forgot, because the knowledge that he was a smash character did not *exist* yet, **sora!** i... think... sora is really silly. he wears big silly shoes, he's a cheerful optimist, he's voiced by *forrest gump's son* who would eventually grow up to become *jd vance* on *jimmy kimmel live???* he's best friends with donald duck and goofy for crying out loud! i don't quite know if he's top-10 silly, but he's *the* honorable mention. let's put him *above* luigi and *below* yoshi.

<small>okay, i think that's everyone! i know i said i'd self-host the images on this site, but i'm not uploading images of all of these characters, out of fear of both copyright infringement (which is much more of a problem here than it would be on a social media site, believe it or not) and sheer tedium.]</small>

welcome to **the smash ultimate roster ranked from most serious to silliest,** the *first ranked list to inhabit this website!* honestly, i started this list a long, long time ago--around the time min min was introduced into the roster. in fact, that was a year ago next week (as of this list's release!) i promised to finish the list and post it as the first ranked list on the site after e3 2021 came and went, and it... definitely came and went. so, let's go ahead and settle it... in smash! ...i'm so funny.

            <h2>82. ridley</h2>
            <p><strong>holy shit, look at him! he's huge!</strong> in fact, he's the biggest character in smash ultimate! this dragon means fucking business. he will piledrive your head right into the ground and then send you careening into hell faster than you can say peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers three times fast. or one time, probably. <strong>do not fuck with this dragon, it will kill you.</strong></p>

            <h2>76. Zero Suit Samus</h2>
            <p>I missed an opportunity not putting Zero Suit Samus in 69, didn't I? Seriously, though, she's serious. She has a giant mech suit and if she CHOOSES to beat your ass instead, then it's probably not gonna be a good day for said ass.</p>

            <h2>75. Dark Samus</h2>
            <p>I would put this higher on the silliness scale than Samus for falling into the esteemed "does not need to exist" section of the Smash roster, but... I dunno, she looks pretty menacing...</p>

            <p>Samus can probably kill you in one blast. Not you, as in your Smash main, Smash characters are strong--I mean you in real life. Think about that.</p>

            <h2>73. Mythra</h2>
            <p>I don't like thinking about Xenoblade, it makes me feel like an angry, balding Twitter gamer. And as for Mythra, I personally feel like taking a cold shower after just looking at her--she and Pyra are simply the quintessential examples of anime girls that grody, sweaty guys like to fawn over... but that doesn't mean anything in regards to how I feel about them! I just mean they're a little hard to talk about. But I'll get into these two anyway, just for you, internaut! ‚ù§</p>

            <h2>72. Pyra</h2>
            <p>Listen, I'm writing these two particular entries while going back and finishing this list after E3 2021, and I've grown in terms of these lists since I first started writing this one after Min Min's debut! That means it's my responsibility to think about my placements a bit more. I put Pyra and Mythra this far down because, unlike a lot of the other characters on this list, I decided to look a bit into their roles in the game's story... and I ended up finding out that a lot of the game is about them searching for a way to die because they both feel like a burden to others. ...Jeez.</p>

            <h2>71. Richter</h2>
            <p>Listen, I haven't played any Castlevania games except for the one on NES, but I am led to believe that he has a chain, and I'm too scared to predict what he would do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZHi4UHT7ZKo?t=78" target="_blank">Maybe kick our asphalt?</a></p>

            <h2>70. Kazuya</h2>
            <p>I tried to find out this guy's story by going to his wiki page, but holy fuck, believe me when I say Tekken lore is about as extensive as the Bible... in many different ways. So I'm just gonna put him above Richter because he looks real scary and I don't want him to hurt me! :(</p>

            <p>I love Meta Knight. Meta Knight is serious enough that he can actually be menacing, but he has some silly traits too. Ya just can't help but love the little shit. Oh hey, he has a sword! We can make him sword pal #1.5!</p>

            <p>Sword pal #2 dresses in style, and she probably has some gall too, by the looks of it... just another blue-haired weirdo who loves looking cool, but not actually being interesting. Go over with Sonic. [Disclaimer: Sonic is a very good, interesting, fun character who I love with every fiber of my being. This is a joke.]</p>

            <h2>63. Byleth</h2>
            <p>Sword pal #3 is... literally just Chrom again. Come on, guys. Give us a lovable, functioning, original character. Did... did Japan even like this? I don't know. Anyway, I probably shouldn't keep complaining. Byleth is okay! Next!</p>

            <p>And here we are at, you guessed it, sword pal #4. Marth just seemed a little more... unnerved than the other few sword pals. It makes him seem the tiniest bit more lovable and silly. Plus, his boots look like Crash Bandicoot crates!</p>

Anyway, there isn't really much to say about Steve! He was meant to just be a blank canvas for the Minecraft players to paint on circumstantially, and that's kind of how he works in this game too. He isn't really too silly or serious! Though, if I had to put him on either side, I'd definitely say silly, which is why I put him just above the middle!</p>

            <p>Remember when I said "I would put this higher on the silliness scale than Samus for falling into the esteemed "does not need to exist" section of the Smash roster, but...?" Take that and remove the "would," remove the "but" and replace Samus with Pit.</p>

            <p>And here we are--the man himself. I would be so inclined as to say that Sonic is the most iconic character we've talked about so far! He can get pretty serious sometimes. I mean, he's the one who taught us that we can't use buildings as a canvas, and did so by making us remember the damning, thought-provoking conundrum that it is, in fact... graffiti. Well, I'm convinced--I'm never doing it again! (Not that I've ever done it before.) And also, he's had some pretty big, daunting stories over the years... but at the end of the day, he's still the butt of every joke on the internet and Sonic '06 and Sonic Boom still exist. So, he's a silly boy.</p>

Honestly, Splatoon and ARMS are kind of the same deal--just different gimmicks. They're kid-friendly fighting games that have really silly gimmicks and some unusually in-depth lore. I just think Min Min's gimmick is sillier than Inkling's.</p>

If you don't believe me, watch the Super Mario World animated series, or just watch the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls animation.

He's an Italian plumber from Brooklyn with a handlebar mustache who was sucked down the drain and landed in a kingdom of mushrooms that looks like a bad trip, constantly plunging in and out of total anarchy, just like Mario constantly plunged in and out of the dang NEW YORK TOILETS. In fact, the only reason why he isn't higher is because each of his games are about animal genocide in the name of the government.</p>
