<br>
one of the most intricate (and one of the... only) castles i've ever drawn! specifically, i drew this as concept art for a minecraft build that i was doing for a urlfest called bugquest a couple years ago at this point! if you know me very well, you'll know i was very involved in a *series* of urlfests called **bugfest,** and bugquest was one of the lesser known-about events. it was, however, the one that took the longest to set into motion! i made a lot of stuff for bugquest, and i might post about my experiences in the future, but for now, take a look at this super guinea-pig-inspired castle!
