**picnic panic!** is a fruit themed clone of tetris attack and shock switch from flight rising originally made for the "strawberry to the heart" game jam in march of 2022! match berries to fill the basket, but don't let the board overflow! (alex and i originally finished this up on march 16, 2022, so expect a few bugs! i tried to squish most of 'em before putting this up self-hosted, but i'm not a superhero!)
## controls
use your **mouse** to click on the board and swap two fruits! press **W** or **space** or **left-click** on the berry bumper to make a new row of fruit with the berry bumper to match more fruit for combos! learn more in the in-game instructions!
## changelog
- 1.1.01: the ever-impressive, the long-contained (october 1, 2024)
    - converted unsupported .ogg files to .mp3 files. (safari does not support the ogg container)
- 1.1: quality of life! (september 25, 2024)
    - toni.zone is now picnic panic's forever home!
    - optimized canvas display for mobile devices! (game is still optimized for desktop, but it's easier for mobile users to play now!)
    - added click/tap functionality to berry bumper (for mobile users!)
    - added pre-loader and loading graphics (audio using the web audio api cannot be played until the user clicks. also apparently high-quality ogg files take *time to load* or something?)
    - added combo loss sound effect
    - made audio overall slightly quieter
    - fixed extremely loud title screen bug
    - fixed warning sound playing on level reset bug
    - fixed level not resetting when choosing survival mode bug
    - fixed options menu not darkening background after hitting "main menu" bug
    - fixed "game over" and "you win" not counting as music or sound effects bug (they're sound effects now)
    - fixed berry bumper not progressing for a very long time in second survival mode game bug
- 1.0: game release (march 16, 2022)
