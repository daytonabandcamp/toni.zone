# I'm TONI!

Would you look at that? It's me! The one on ~~the logo~~ that little picture up there! Man, I wish I were still on the logo... but that's just the way the cookie crumbles. At least you can see me in the little bumper stickers I'm making for (some of) the content on this website! Oh, and I also wrote, designed and configured this entire website all by myself! Anyway, enough bragging--I'M **TONI** (she/her,) but you can call me Daytona or Day if you'd so please!! Really, though, Daytona is kind of my *stage* name more than anything. As for my age, I'm **21** years old as of the last time this page was updated! Maybe I'm actually 22 or older, though, and I've just forgotten to update the site for a long time. Probably not! All you really need to know about me, though, is that I'm a polyamorous transfemme enby leftist with a frankly ridiculous amount of free time, and as such, I fear no god. â™¥

# Regardin' What I Take Part In

Let's see here. Well, I'm sort of a jack of all trades! Well, a few of 'em, anyway. That is to say I use my time for all sorts of different, only slightly related things!

- I do synthy electronica and hyperpop music as well as game soundtracks!!
- I really, really like Minecraft!!
- I love ranking things in lists and putting them on this site!
- I'm an animator and I usually draw and animate cartoons regarding my special interests!!
- I'm an indie game developer!! I've been slacking as of late, but I wanna get back into it! (But only for fun! ...Mostly for fun.)
- I do a few different types of cartoony and 3D art, including every piece of art you've seen on the website so far!! [except for like... the creative commons license image.]
- I know how to program (kind of) in multiple languages!

# More to come soon!

What else could you possibly wanna know about me, though? I mean, pretty much all of it can be found elsewhere on this website, at least if you look hard enough. However, that doesn't mean I'm not gonna put more stuff on this page later! Happy stalking!
