Hey there! Do you have a problem with the dang darn website? Is there something you think could look better? Do you wanna send me fan stuff, ask me a question about anything or just have someone to talk to? Well, I'm not immediately gonna give you my Discord, that's for darn sure. That's for my friends!

But if ya wanna *be* my friend, you can talk to me on my <a href="mailto: daytonabandcamp@gmail.com">public email</a> (which you can just click on the link to send a message to, so I don't have to publicly spell it out for everyone to see!)

If it's cool enough and you say you want me to, I might even answer it on the site instead of emailing you back!
