        <p>I do a few different types of cartoony art, including every piece of art you've seen on the website so far!! [with the exception of the super old / olden-stylized buttons and gifs i borrowed <spoiler>(stole)</spoiler>]</p>

    <h1>I Love My Friends</h1>
    <p>Surprise!!! I know this page is supposed to be about me, but I gotta give a serious shoutout to some of my <b>absolutely amazing close friends</b> for keepin' me happy and sane enough to keep going on and on in this world. Really, my life would be awful if it weren't for every one of you on this list! Anyone who isn't following these people on socials if they have them, please go and do that right now!</p>
    <br>
        <p><b>Alex</b> (@AlexBrawn9)<br>You're just so joyful to be around and I always love talking to you so much. You light up every room you're in and you make me extremely comfortable! I love you so so so much!!</p>
        <p><b>Chris</b><br>Chris, I only understand about 2% of the things you show me, but you're just the best, and I really love it whenever we talk. You're cute too and I love you to the moon and back!!</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>Anna</b><br>Even if I might come off as annoyingly blunt a lot of the time, I'm extremely grateful that you're there for me always. I love you and you're pretty awesome! ❤</p>
        <p><b>Arda</b> (@yeet_the_rich)<br>Even though you're British, I love you all the same, you gay-ass lifeform. Let's talk more!</p>
        <p><b>Aurora</b><br>You're an amazing friend and I admire how strong you are. We've been through thick and thin together and I appreciate you and everything about you. Fan herte!</p>
        <p><b>Becky</b> (@killakiddbecky)<br>You are just the best!! You're so fun to be around and you make me feel really in my element. I love your music and I hope you never stop making it! ❤</p>
        <p><b>Cap</b> (@C4ptianmcd3rp)<br>Goodness gracious Cap, I hope we stay friends for even longer than Homestar's pants are. You never fail to make me laugh and astound me with your skill in whatever you do!</p>
        <p><b>Connie</b> (@vapor_spams)<br>YOU ARE AMAZING. I've been entranced by your art ever since we met and you inspire me just as much as I (hopefully) inspire you! Keep on a-going!!</p>
        <p><b>Endeneka</b> (@3nd3n3ka)<br>YOUR ARTSTYLE IS SO COOL!! And you're just so amazing as a person too! Please, please, PLEASE keep making art!!!</p>
        <p><b>Isaac</b> (@bruiserjason1)<br>I always love having a funny little twink character in my life, and you suffice just fine. &gt;:)</p>
        <p><b>Jeet</b> (@jeet_320)<br>Even if we don't talk a lot, you've liked so many of my stupid Twitter tirades in the past that I can't help but respect you and think of you as a good friend. Plus, you're amazing at art!</p>
        <p><b>Katie</b> (@dennys_fan2001)<br>I think I feel more comfortable being loose around you than any other person I've ever met. You're just so easygoing and fun to talk to! I love being around you so much. ❤</p>
        <p><b>Nat</b> (@Wasmoy)<br>You're, for one, absolutely adorable. Like, so adorable that I have to point it out. And also, you run one hell of a tabletop campaign!! And even though that chapter in our lives has past, I hope you run another one soon and I'm happy you're in mine! ❤</p>
        <p><b>Night System</b> (night_dragon937)<br>I couldn't possibly overstate how wonderful you are and how amazing it feels to be around you. Being in the Pantheon SMP has just been such a delightful experience and I'm so happy you gave me the opportunity! Love you so so so much!</p>
        <p><b>Nin</b> (@Nintender247)<br>Holy shit, dude, if I were as amazing as you at fighting games, I'd have a child and teach them everything I know.</p>
        <p><b>Queen</b> (QueenOfRodents)<br>I love you more than I can put into words. You're kind, amazing, beautiful, strong, and all kinds of other wonderful, gushy adjectives. You're one of the most talented people I know and I can't stress that enough! I just can't give you enough praise.</p>
        <p><b>Ruby</b><br>Ruby, you mean nothing less than the world to me. You are a beautiful, kind, strong, lovely, sweet, caring human being who radiates creativity and never fails to brighten my day. I wish I could just hug you forever--that would make me the happiest person in the world. I love you in every sense of the word. ❤</p>
        <p><b>Rachel</b> (@strawbchel)<br>Rachel, I'm going to unapologetically claim that you have the best voice out of any of my friends by an extremely wide margin. On top of that, you're beautiful and sweeter than honey! ❤</p>
        <p><b>Peng</b> (@Pengyaboi)<br>Peng, you're just absolutely delightful to be around. You're so sweet and I absolutely loved seeing you in my Twitter notifications while I was on there. Let's talk more!</p>
        <p><b>Phoenix</b><br>Phoenix, you are just... beyond what words can describe. I can't overstate how happy it makes me whenever we talk, and if more people in this world were like you, then the world would be a better place. ❤</p>
        <p><b>Orchid System</b> (@oworchidsystem)<br>I hope I'm not being repetitive with this list, but I love talking to you so much--you're so sweet and I really think we're on the same page with a lot of things! I love you and I'm really glad we're friends. ❤</p>
        <p><b>Title</b> (@tbok1992)<br>I feel like if I never met you, I'd be a dickhead. You introduced me to a lot of fundamental values I couldn't live without, as well as a lot of great friends, and for that, I'm forever grateful!</p>
    <p>So that's what I am, that's what I'll be. I don't really know how to end this, but I'm happy you read through the whole thing (or even just some of it!) I hope this can bring some context to the rest of the content on this page for you! :></p>
